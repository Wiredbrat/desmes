Desmes - Kanban Board

Desmes is a simple and intuitive Kanban-style task management tool. It allows users to organize tasks into three categories: To Do, Ongoing, and Completed. Tasks can be dragged between categories, added dynamically, and stored in the browser's local storage for persistent state across sessions.

Features

Add tasks: Easily add new tasks to the "To Do" column.

Drag and drop: Move tasks between "To Do", "Ongoing", and "Completed" columns.

Local storage: The tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

Task deletion: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the board.
